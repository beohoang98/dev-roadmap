- **Analysis**: 
	You have a hug data set containing data of various types. Instead of tackling the entire dataset and running the risk of becoming overwhelmed, you separated into easier to digest chunks and study them individually and examine how they relate to other part. That is analysis in a nutshell.

	One important thing to remember is that you perform analysis in **things have already happened in the past**. (e.g using an analysis to explain how? and why? something happened).

- **Analytics**: generally refers to the future instead of explaining past events. It explores potential future ones. Analytics is essentially the application of logical and computational reasoning to the components parts obtained in an analysis and in doing this you are looking for patterns in exploring what you can do with them in the future.



- **Qualitative Analytics**: 
	This is using your intuition and experience in conjunction with the analysis to plan your next business move. 

- **Quantitative Analytics**: 
	This is applying formulas and algorithms to numbers you have gathered from your analysis
